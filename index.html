        <p>I started running 3 years ago. I've partcipated in both Track and Field and Cross Country. I enjoy running for many reasons. First off, running is the closest I can be to flying (apart from actually flying). Also, I have made many friends in the running community. Another important note is that it gives me the opportunity to clear my thoughts when I am stressed out--by allowing me to focus in on my surroundings and myself.</p>
